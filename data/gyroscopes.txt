	description `This dense module takes advantage of a rotating wheel of compressed and reinforced metal for two purposes: To store kinetic energy as a flywheel, and to produce torque. The motor that spins the gyroscope can either consume electricity to increase the gyroscope's speed, or resist that spin to return electricity, essentially making this function as a battery.`
	description `Its second use is to produce torque. The entire module is mounted on a gimbal, which it can rotate to transfer some of the gyroscope's rotational energy to the ship, allowing the ship to rotate without the need for conventional thrusters.` 
	description `	CMG Gyroscopes require an input of energy at all times to power their electromagnetic bearings.`

	description `This is the largest CMG Gyroscope made commercially available so far, which can be a suitable swap with a ship's battery if their generators are already good enough, but their steering isn't. Besides ships, you can find gyroscopes like these in the cores of many major space stations around Human space.`

	description `Instead of using chemicals to store power, electricity can instead by converted to and from kinetic energy and stored in two conversely rotating flywheels. They consist of a reinforced, very dense metal inside a vacuum chamber, and suspended with magnetic bearings. Energy can be extracted using its internal motor-generator to generate a current by taking away rotational energy, or to use electricity to add rotational energy.`
